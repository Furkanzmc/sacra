## App Overview

### Why We Are Developing Sacra

We are two passionate developers that enjoy rock climbing. The one reason that we are doing this is
to have fun, to enjoy; everything else is secondary and will follow naturally.

We are developing a climbing app, in which you can log your climbing sessions. Strava of climbing,
if you will. The very first iteration you would manually log in the session. In more advanced
    versions:

For bouldering: you would log your tries, the levels, the routes

For top rope: the grades, the heights of climbs, the falls

For lead: the grade, falls, heights

The social media aspect of it; more recently with a new generation of climbers (mostly bouldering) a
lot of young climbers log their climbs with a video. Climbing naturally a supportive activity that
other climbers can cheer on the climber, the person that is posting the video. Also, climbing can be
a group activity, you could find a climbing partner on the app for example.

The outdoor and the web element: There is a huge need for a user data driven of outdoor crags. It
could be a great database for users to find cool spots to climb.

Pro subscriptions: A pro climber can advertise a new documentary, a new merch, or a new video they
dropped on their socials. Also services such as guiding, coaching, etc can be advertized. 

Gym subscriptions: they can advertise their new routes, the gym itself, features, walls, etc.

The virtual guidebooks: Wrangle the data generated by the user, provide useful information about the
route to the user. Kinda like alltrails. 

Colab with climbing brands to point to their store for example, or could be as simple as only pro
users can add a link to their social media for a shoe they are using, they can do affiliate
marketing, will drive users to want to upgrade to pro. Obviously, complicated but there is a niche
to be explored.

It is extremely important to make it as easy as possible to log new climbs.

##### Home Screen

This is where we display some statistics. We display the number of climb activities this week, the
goal that the user set for herself and whether that goal has been reached, and the list of
activities below that.

The statistics graphs are displayed in a swipe area so that we can swipe through different stats,
but also we can expand them into a list view.

This is where we also see a list of the past sessions. The sessions are displayed in a grid, and
each card shows brief information about the session.

Here's what the card displays:

- Activity type
- Activity date/time
- Number of routes/problems
- Number of flashes/sends
- And it also shows how heigh the user climbed and it compares the height to climbing some famous
  mountains.

When the user taps on the cards, a sheet view to display the activity details who up.

##### Activity Logging Screen

On this screen, the user can add a note for the session, log attempts, and change the details of the
attempts.

Each attempt comes with the following details:

- The log number
- Whether it was a flash or sent
- Whether it was completed
- Difficulty
- Number of attempts
- A note

The goal is the make it as easy as possible to log these attempts.

##### Profile Screen

This is where we display the profile photo for the user and show some additional information.
The highest difficult they climb for bouldering, top rope, and lead.
The home gym, the gym that they usually go to.
And some other things.

This is where they can also go to the settings page.

## Design

The app's design will feel like it was developed by Apple on iOS, and by Google on Android. It
should follow a similar design to Apple Health and Apple Fitness on iOS, and Google Health and
Google Fit on Android.
